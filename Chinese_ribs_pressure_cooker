------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions:
1 If your ribs are not separated begin by removing the membrane on the bottom* and then cut into individual ribs.
2 Season the ribs with the salt, Szechuan pepper, and the five spice.
3 Roughly chop the onion and remove the skins from the garlic and place in the base of the instant pot followed by the water.
4 Add a trivet followed by the ribs and then seal the lid and cook on manual high pressure for 20 minutes.
5 Whilst the pressure cooker is cooking, heat your oven as high as you can get it.
6 Add all of the ingredients for the glaze into a pan and bring to a simmer.
7 Allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes and then carefully remove the ribs.
8 Drain off the cooking liquid and discard leaving behind the onions and garlic.
9 Add this to a blender along with the glaze and blend to a smooth paste.
10 Pass through a fine mesh sieve and then coat your ribs.
Drop them in the oven as hot as you can get it and allow them to crisp up and colour, this will take around 10-12 minutes.
